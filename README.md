## Description
This is an app that serves as a platform to share and solve coding algorithms. This website enables developers to connect with each other in order to strengthen their critical thinking abilities and problem solving skills. Ultimately, our team wants to make it easier for developers to work together in order to become better coders. Our users are developers who want to improve their skills, improve their apps, and improve their chances at securing their dream job. This is what motivates us - Building a place for developers to come together so that they can build better apps and make the world a better place.
